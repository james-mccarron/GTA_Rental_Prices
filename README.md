# GTA Rental Prices Prediction / Visualization #

End-to-end machine learning project applied to real-world business problem. This project is trying to depict rental situation in Toronto and find out what affects the current prices. Focus is on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and hyper parameter tuning.

## Key Takeawys ##

- Efficient web scraping
- Self-built dataset & feature engineering
- Geographical data visualization
- Standardizing, transforming, handling missing data
- Creating custom objectives and evaluations for ML model
- Automatic hyperparameter tuning
- Model averaging and Model Stacking

## Datasets ##

- Handcrafted housing data (~30000 of the most recently leased homes)
- Geographical data of GTA neighbourhoods
- Neighbourhood profiles (6 â€“ years old)
- Geographical data of Toronto subway lines/stations

## Limitations ##

- Toronto underwent some redistricitng in March 2022, and the new districts' median incomes have not been released in any census data as of making this project. The median incomes of the new districts that are displayed are taken from the previous district name from the 2016 Census.
